2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder. 
What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?

If a number is divisible by x and y, then the number is also divisible by lcm of x and y

lcm of x and y = product of x and y / gcd of x ad y

To get the required number we can find lcm of every number from 1 to 20. Since, we know 2520 is number divisble by all number from 1 to 10
and the required number is also divisible by all number from 1 to 10, the required number is divisible by 2520. So we can get the required number
by finding lm of every number from 10 to 20 rather than start from 1.
